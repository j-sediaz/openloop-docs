## Overview

OpenLoop organizes healthcare services into **Clinical Verticals** (bundles) containing related programs. Each program represents a specific condition or treatment area with its own questionnaire and associated products.

<Info>
Programs use **abbreviation IDs** (e.g., ADHD, MHL, ED) as unique identifiers across the API.

</Tip>

<Warning>
Always check the `gender` field before displaying programs to users to avoid showing gender-specific programs to the wrong audience.
</Warning>

<Note>
Programs with `active: false` should not be displayed to end users but may appear in historical data.
