## Authentication

The Partners API supports two authentication methods. Include your credentials in every API request.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="API Key">
  **Recommended for most integrations**
  
  Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header:

  ```bash
  curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
       https://api-staging.openloophealth.com/patients
  ```

  <Info>
  API keys provide simple, secure server-to-server authentication without token management complexity.
  </Info>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Bearer Token">
  **For OAuth2 flows**
  
  Include your bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
