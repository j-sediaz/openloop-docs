## Your First Integration in 10 Minutes

Ready to transform your practice? This guide will have you connected and referring your first patient to specialized care in under 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **API Key** - Contact our partnership team to obtain your credentials
- **HTTP Client** - curl, Postman, or your preferred API testing tool  
- **Basic API Knowledge** - Familiarity with RESTful APIs and JSON

<Warning>
Never commit your API key to version control or share it publicly. Store it securely in environment variables.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Your Connection">
  Start by confirming your API credentials are working correctly with a health check request.
  
  <Note>
  Use the staging environment for testing before moving to production.
  </Note>

  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
       https://api-staging.openloophealth.com/health
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js
  const response = await fetch('https://api-staging.openloophealth.com/health', {
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': process.env.OPENLOOP_API_KEY
    }
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests
  import os

  response = requests.get(
      'https://api-staging.openloophealth.com/health',
      headers={'x-api-key': os.environ['OPENLOOP_API_KEY']}
  )

  print(response.json())
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  **Expected Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "name": "partners-api",
    "version_date": "2025-11-21T16:51:50.139Z"
  }
  ```

  <Check>
  If you receive this response, your API credentials are configured correctly and you're ready to proceed.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Your First Patient">
  Create a patient record with all required demographic and contact information.

  <RequestExample>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST https://api-staging.openloophealth.com/patients \
    -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "phone": "+1-555-0123",
      "birth_date": "1990-05-15",
      "gender": "male",
      "sex": "male",
      "locations": [{
        "address_line_1": "123 Main Street",
        "address_line_2": "Apt 4B",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "country": "US",
        "zip_code": "10001",
        "default": true,
        "type": "home"
      }]
    }'
  ```
  </RequestExample>

  <ResponseExample>
  ```json Success
  {
    "message": "Patient created successfully",
    "data": {
      "patient": {
        "id": "pat_1a2b3c4d5e6f",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "phone": "+1-555-0123",
        "birth_date": "1990-05-15",
        "created_at": "2024-12-02T10:30:00Z"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  </ResponseExample>

  <Tip>
  Save the `patient.id` from the response. You'll need it for subsequent operations like enrollments and updates.

## Authentication

The Partners API supports two authentication methods. Choose the one that fits your integration needs.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="API Key (Recommended)">
  Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header for simple, secure authentication.

  ```bash
  curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
       https://api-staging.openloophealth.com/patients
  ```

  <Info>
  API keys are ideal for server-to-server integrations and provide straightforward authentication.
  </Info>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Bearer Token">
  Use OAuth2-style bearer tokens in the `Authorization` header.

  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
       https://api-staging.openloophealth.com/patients
  ```

  <Note>
  Bearer tokens offer more flexibility for complex authentication flows and token rotation.
