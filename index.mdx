## What is the Partner API for?

This API enables businesses to operate using the OpenLoop clinical platform. We have a range of programs including Medical Weight Loss (MWL), Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT), and many others that can be handles by the OpenLoop clinical team. In order to do this, partners must integrate with this API to send patients to our platform.
